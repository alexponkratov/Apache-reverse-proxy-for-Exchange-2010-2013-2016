conf file for Apache/2.4.7 and SSL

- I still have a lot of authenticate request using Kerberos (Http code 401) with webmail.conf. (I will try to fix that... later)
- An alternative is to use basic Authentication: you need to be sure that Basic is enabled for all the used services! The working conf is "webmail - BasicAuth.conf"
